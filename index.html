        This is a tool meant for people playing any games in the Pokemon franchise that will help them create
        teams of 6 Pokemon. It provides means of analyzing individuals, as well as whole teams. It also helps
        players find Pokemon by highlighting their locations on in-game maps.

        Over the course of this project, we may have gone a little overboard in adding features. We were just
        having so much fun that we wanted to keep going until the very last minute. Matt discovered a newfound love for Data Scraping.
        We both got a lot of experience
        working in D3, and other Javascript libraries. We also got some more exposure to cleaning incomplete or dirty datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
        For anyone curious about data scraping, we both recommend looking at the Pokemon Dataset, as it provides a
        good mix of intuitive data, but it isn't so straightforward as to be trivial to obtain.

    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon">The Pokemon Dataset on Kaggle</a> was a great starting dataset. While it may not be nearly as "complete" as its name implies, it was a great starting point.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://serebii.net/">Serebii.net</a> was an exellent resource for data scraping. We used this to correct, enhance, and expand our base dataset with evolution, stat, location, and sprite data
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page">Bulbapedia</a> is a comprehensive source on all things Pokemon. We got our maps from here, in addition to a lot of contextual in game knowledge.

    <a href="http://tabulator.info/">Tabulator</a> was an instrumental tool in constructing our table data.
